“
“Thank you, Chair, for that kind introduction.”



“Before I begin, a brief disclosure. I am the CEO and founder of
Phantomics , a company developing AI-powered cardiac imaging solutions. My perspective today combines both clinical and innovation experience.”


“Chest pain is one of the most common reasons for ER visits in the U.S., nearly 8 million annually.
Most cases are benign, but a small fraction involve ACS, pulmonary embolism, or aortic dissection.
The challenge is rapid and accurate differentiation, since ECGs and blood tests are often inconclusive. This leads to over-triage, long ER stays, high costs, and overcrowding—highlighting the need for faster, safer triage.”



“This chart illustrates the causes of chest pain by age.
Across all age groups, nonspecific chest pain remains the most common.
These patterns underscore the importance of efficiently ruling out coronary artery disease—the most critical cause of acute chest pain in the ER with high sensitivity and negative predictive value.”



“CCTA is increasingly guideline-endorsed.
The 2021 U.S. guideline gives Class I, Level A for intermediate-risk patients with no known CAD after inconclusive ACS evaluation.
The 2023 European guideline gives Class IIa , Level A for suspected ACS without ECG or troponin changes.
Together, these confirm CCTA’s growing role in safe and efficient decision-making.”



“The reason is clear: CCTA has a very high negative predictive value, allowing safe and rapid exclusion of CAD.
It reduces length of stay in chest pain units and improves long-term outcomes by lowering future coronary events and cardiac deaths.
CCTA is now a cornerstone in chest pain evaluation.”



“This algorithm shows how CCTA fits in.
For intermediate-risk patients with no known CAD, test choice depends on local expertise.
If there’s a recent negative test, repeat testing may not be needed.
Otherwise, CCTA or stress imaging are options. FFR-CT adds functional insight but turnaround time may limit use.
High-risk disease, like left main or triple-vessel stenosis, should go directly to invasive angiography.”



“CCTA rapidly rules out significant CAD, particularly in low-to-intermediate risk patients.
It reduces time to diagnosis, shortens ER stays, cuts unnecessary admissions, and lowers costs.
Importantly, it also provides anatomic detail—plaque burden and features—with strong prognostic value.”



One of the greatest advantages of coronary CT angiography is its ability to rapidly and safely rule out ACS, with a negative predictive value approaching 100% in low- to intermediate-risk patients.
In the ROMICAT trial, CCTA excluded ACS in 71% of patients with inconclusive initial assessment.
Compared to traditional pathways, it significantly shortens time to diagnosis—ROMICAT II and CT-STAT showed reductions of up to 55%.
This translates into much shorter ER stays—about 6 to 7 hours saved—and lower healthcare costs through fewer admissions and optimized resource use.



This study highlights the importance of 24 hours and 7 days cardiac CT angiography interpretation in the emergency department.
Among 658 CCTA cases, examinations occurred across all hours, with a wide spectrum of CAD-RADS scores reflecting disease severity.
In patients who proceeded to invasive coronary catheterization, the data show consistent links between CCTA findings and downstream management, including PCI and CABG.
These results emphasize that timely, round-the-clock access to expert CCTA interpretation can directly impact patient triage and treatment decisions in acute care.



“Yet access is limited.
Only 46% of U.S. safety-net hospitals offer CCTA.
Availability ranges from 8% in small hospitals to nearly 90% in large centers.
There’s also a rural–urban gap—22% vs 57%—and a stark contrast between academic centers at 97% and non-academic at 41%.
This inequity must be addressed.”



“A typical workflow begins with patient presentation, risk assessment by HEART score, troponins, and ECG.
If appropriate, CCTA is performed—after IV prep, HR control if needed, and nitroglycerin.
The scan is acquired and reconstructed for stenosis and plaque.
Based on results: no CAD means safe discharge; non-obstructive CAD means medical therapy; obstructive or uncertain findings lead to cardiology consult, FFR-CT, or invasive angiography.”



While CCTA offers clear benefits in the ER, several challenges limit its widespread use.
Confidence and training remain key issues—many physicians are still unfamiliar or reluctant, and expertise is not always readily available.
Resources and logistics, including scanner access and staff coverage, also create barriers.
There are technical limitations and complexities in selecting the right patients image quality, radiation exposure, contrast use, etc.
Together, these factors highlight the need for more education, streamlined protocols, and better integration of CCTA into emergency workflows.



“In our own study of 766 off-hour CCTAs, discrepancies between resident preliminaries and final staff reports occurred in 11%.
Predictors were low ED crowding index and positive calcium scores.
Importantly, discrepancies led to more unnecessary invasive angiography.
This highlights the need for better resident training and stronger decision support.”



To expand the role of CCTA in the ER, several solutions are needed.
Standardized protocols with AI-integrated pathways can ensure consistency and efficiency.
Comprehensive education and training will build clinician confidence and expertise.
Optimizing technology and accessibility, supported by robust AI implementation, will further streamline workflows.
Finally, strengthening inter-department collaboration and focusing on value and cost-effectiveness will make CCTA a sustainable, high-impact tool in acute chest pain care.



“Technology also plays a role.
In this study, we compared single-source CT requiring beta-blockers to dual-source CT without HR control.
Dual-source CT cut acquisition time, improved image quality, reduced nondiagnostic exams, and eliminated beta-blocker use—without affecting safety.
This shows how new hardware can simplify ER workflows.”



“AI’s impact extends beyond efficiency. It improves workflow and workload, but more importantly, integrates stenosis, plaque burden, and pericoronary fat with biomarkers and ECG.
This enables earlier detection of subclinical disease and better prediction of major adverse cardiac events, moving us toward personalized risk assessment and care.”


AI can transform the use of CCTA in the emergency setting.
First, it accelerates triage and diagnosis by providing rapid preliminary analysis, flagging urgent cases, and cutting report turnaround times.
Second, it reduces radiologist workload by automating segmentation, measurements, and draft reporting—freeing experts to focus on complex decision-making, and helping manage rising case volumes, especially after hours.
Finally, AI improves standardization by reducing inter-observer variability, ensuring more consistent and reliable reporting across institutions.



In our own work, a YOLO-based model trained on 10,000 images achieved an AUC of 0.92 and an excellent negative predictive value of 98.5% per artery.
At the patient level, sensitivity reached 93% with a negative predictive value of 96.6%, supporting its clinical utility for ruling out obstructive CAD in the ED.



AI in cardiac CT goes far beyond simply detecting stenosis.
It integrates multiple parameters—such as plaque burden and composition.
This enhances predictive power, allowing more accurate forecasting of major adverse cardiac events and the detection of subclinical disease.
By generating individualized risk profiles, AI supports personalized medicine.



“Clinical studies confirm this. This multicenter study analyzed over 400 ED patients with acute chest pain who underwent coronary CT angiography.
Using a deep learning model, patients were categorized into no CAD, non-obstructive CAD, or obstructive CAD.
During follow-up, 15% experienced major adverse cardiac events.
Obstructive CAD identified by the DL model was the strongest independent predictor of events, with a hazard ratio of 88.
Importantly, adding DL-based CAD extent to clinical risk factors significantly improved risk stratification, raising the Harrell C statistic from 0.80 to 0.94.


High-risk plaque features on CT coronary angiography are key predictors of acute coronary events.
They include positive remodeling, spotty calcification, low-attenuation plaque, and the napkin-ring sign.
Identifying these features helps refine risk stratification in patients with suspected non–ST-elevation ACS.



“And this is already reaching practice. Companies like
Cleerly, Elucid, and HeartFlow are now translating this science into practice. Their AI-powered plaque quantification tools are reimbursed under Category III CPT codes, and validated against IVUS and pathology. AI has made reliable, scalable plaque quantification feasible in clinical practice.


AI is helping to overcome several barriers to broader CCTA adoption.
It addresses expertise gaps by providing decision support in hospitals without dedicated cardiac radiologists and imaging cardiologists, ensuring more consistent reads.
AI also improves cost-effectiveness—accelerating diagnosis, reducing unnecessary admissions, and optimizing resources.
It facilitates complex analyses like FFR-CT by automating time-consuming steps.
Finally, AI supports standardized training and quality control, serving as both a teaching tool and a benchmark for performance.



Our vision for AI-powered Always-On CCTA is seamless integration into emergency workflows.
It enables rapid and precise diagnosis, providing personalized risk assessment at the point of care.
This translates into improved patient outcomes and optimized resource utilization.
Ultimately, it positions CCTA as a true cornerstone of acute cardiac care—always available, always reliable, and powered by AI to transform how we manage chest pain in the ER.



“In conclusion:
CCTA is guideline-endorsed and highly effective for chest pain evaluation in the ER.
But challenges and disparities persist.
Strong evidence supports its clinical and economic value.
AI is pivotal in expanding its role.
Maximizing benefit requires a multi-pronged approach: technology, education, collaboration, and policy.
Thank you for your attention.”
